# Data organisation and modeling {#data-model}

Once all the data are available, an important task is to organize them to realise the modeling. This organisation needs to respond to a methodic approach. Indeed, to reduce computation time, data have to have an optimised structure.

## Data organisation

The objective is to build models for each hour and compute its related error.

The first step consists of grouping data. Static and dynamic variables are grouped in a data frame. Then, to reduce time computation and to prepare the integration of the data frame for the modeling, there is a way to nest data frames with the library purrr. In this way, it is possible to have one single row for each hour but every row contains data frames inside. The Figure \@ref(fig:nested) shows how it looks. This nested data frame is a efficient way to manipulate many sub-tables at once.

```{r nested, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Structure of a nested data frame", out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figure/purrr_nest.png")
```

In the case of the project, the nested data frame contains one row for each hour which has a data frame containing data from each station at this time. In the Table \@ref(tab:ndf), there is a preview of the data frame contained into each row.

```{r ndf, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(data.n.sample), caption = "Example of nested data frame in a row corresponding to 2016-05-19 15:00:00") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
```


## Modeling

Once the dataset is ready, the next step is to model predictions of temperature. To do that, machine learning is used through R.

### Principle of machine learning

#### Definition

Machine learning is the idea that there are generic algorithms that can tell you something interesting about a set of data without you having to write any custom code specific to the problem. Instead of writing code, you feed data to the generic algorithm and it builds its own logic based on the data. In other words, Machine learning is a subset of deep learning or Artificial Intelligence that provides an ability to “learn” with data. 

There are 2 types of machine learning : supervised and unsupervised learning.

#### Supervised Machine Learning

In practice, most of machine learning uses supervised learning.

From *machinelearningmastery.com* :

>Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output : Y = f(X)
The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x), you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.
It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process

In this learning, the algorithm tries to learn from examples we give to it and then it returns a model of prediction. Classification and regression are supervised machine learning.  

This is the case of the AGROMET project where regression models are used.

#### Unsupervised machine learning

Although that is not the subject, unsupervised learning consists in algorithms which have to find themselves interesting structures in the data. It differs from supervised learning because correct answers are not given to the machine and it has to find answers itself. Association and clustering are unsupervised machine learning.

For example, take 400 pictures of cats and 400 of dogs. While supervised learning will give these pictures with the answer to the machine to make it to find a way to discriminate cats and dogs, unsupervised learning will give only the pictures and the machine will have to find itself differences between cats and dogs separating them in two groups. Obviously, the machine will not know that one group is corresponding to cat and the other to dog because we did not labelled them but the machine will be able to distinguish them like two separate entities.

### Machine learning approach in the AGROMET project

The objective is to predict weather parameters (temperature, relative humidity, leaves wetness). We use data from meteorological stations and from other sources like EUMETSAT for solar irradiance and COPERNICUS for land cover.

Here is our approach :

We choose a weather parameter to predict, temperature for example. It is our __target__.

Then, we define our __explanatory variables__, i.e. the parameters we want to build our model. These variables are our task and it contains target data.

In our case, we will use several statistical methods to build our model like kriging, multiple linear regression model or neural networks. Those which are chosen to build a model are called __learners__ and will be compared.

To measure performance of our predictions, we need to use a __cross-validation resampling strategy__. Several methods exist but we will use the Leave-One-Out cross-validation method. It consists to establish model based on every samples except one which will be the sample where the model is tested to compute the error and then doing it again as many times as the number of samples. The error measured for our models will be the RMSE and MAE.

The entire methodology is detailed in the _Annex 1_.

### Machine Learning in R

All of our work is done on RStudio. It is a very powerful open-source software for R. Moreover, a R package which provides the infrastructure to run machine learning is available. This package **mlr** is very complete to build models, make predictions and evaluate performances.

Machine learning in R offers a common and simplified interface for all statistical methods implemented in the package.

With this package, run a benchmark with several statistical methods can be done on data from a period. This benchmark returns a lot of informations.

It is possible to compare statistical methods through measures of error like RMSE or MAE. Comparing several combinations of explanatory variables is also possible.
