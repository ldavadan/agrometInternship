# Presentation of the AGROMET project and the CRA-W {#presentation}

## CRA-W and Farming Systems, Territory and Information Technologies Unit

The CRA-W was founded in 1872 and depends on the Regional Goverment of Wallonia. It aims to maintain and develop the scientific excellence and societal usefulness and contributes to sustainable development of the agricultural industry in Wallonia in its economic, ecological and cultural dimension. 120 scientifics are working in the CRA-W on three sites (Gembloux, Libramont and Mussy-la-Ville) representing 300 ha of fields, greenhouses, laboratories and offices. The CRA-W is a place for scientific research but also to provide services in agricultural and agri-food sector keeping a perspective view on the development of agriculture.

The research is divided into 4 main fields where more than 100 projects are permanently in progress. : 

- Precision agriculture
- Precision livestock farming
- Risk management
- Understanding products

The CRA-W is divided into 4 departments with 4 research units each :

- Life sciences
- Production et sectors
- Valorisation of agricultural products
- Agriculture and natural environment

The last one has the Unit 11 corresponding to Farming Systems, Territory and Information Technologies Unit where I realized my internship. This Unit develops tools to meet society's new expectations and decision support systems to improve the technico-economic and environmental performance of farming systems. There are actually 28 projects in progress.

The activities of the Unit are the mainly the following :

- Adaptation of agrosystems to global change : definition of references
- Adaptation of agrosystems to global change through bottom-up approaches
- Support to the development of agrosystems in line with territory projects 
- Decision support systems and information technologies for the management of multifunctional agriculture
- Spatial information systems for the management of rural areas.

PAMESEB is a non-profit organisation handle by the CRA-W which aims to promote agrometeorology by taking climatic conditions into account in the walloon agriculture. PAMESEB has 30 weather stations in Wallonia. These stations provide measures for ways to fight crop diseases like late blight and wheat septoria. Stations have a local acquisition unit for hourly data recording. The PAMESEB network has an important place in the AGROMET project because it provides data for it.

Each PAMESEB station has 5 basic sensors :

- Temperature sensor
- Relative humidity sensor
- Solar sensor
- Wind sensor
- Rain gauge


## The AGROMET project

### Context

The European directive 2009/128/CE imposes member-states to set up tools that allow for a more rational use of crop protection products. Among these tools, agricultural warning systems, based on crop monitoring models for the control of pests and diseases are widely adopted and have proved their efficiency. However, due to the difficulty to get meteorological data at high spatial resolution (at the parcel scale), they still are underused. The use of geostatistical tools (Kriging, Multiple Regressions, ANN, etc.) makes it possible to interpolate data provided by physical weather stations in such a way that a high spatial resolution network (mesh size of 1 km2) of virtual weather stations could be generated. 

That is the objective of the AGROMET project. Moreover, some CRA-W's units and other partners are interested in to build models against crop diseases like potato late blight or orange midge which depends on meteorological conditions.

The project was inspired by several academic papers dealing with spatial interpolation of data like _Use of geographic information systems in warning services for late blight_ (Zeuner, 2007), _Decision Support Systems in Agriculture : Administration of Meteorological Data, Use of Geographic Information Systems(GIS) and Validation Methods in Crop Protection Warning Service_ (Racca _et al._, 2011) and _Spatial interpolation of ambient ozone concentrations from sparse monitoring points in Belgium_ (Hooyberghs, 2006).

### Objectives

The project aims to set up an operational web-platform designed for real-time agro-meteorological data dissemination at high spatial (1km2) and temporal (hourly) resolution. To achieve the availability of data at such a high spatial resolution, we plan to "spatialize" the real-time data sent by more than 30 connected physical weather stations belonging to the PAMESEB and RMI networks. This spatialization will then result in a gridded dataset corresponding to a network of 17 000 virtual stations uniformly spread on the whole territory of Wallonia.

These "spatialized" data will be made available through a web-platform providing interactive visualization widgets (maps, charts, tables and various indicators) and an API allowing their use on the fly, notably by agricultural warning systems providers. An extensive and precise documentation about data origin, geo-statistic algorithms used and uncertainty will be also available.

```

Meteorological data wanted to be predict are : 

- Temperature (1.5 meters above the ground)
- Relative humidity (1.5 meters above the ground)
- Leaves wetness
- Rainfall will be spatialized from RMI rain radar data.

To predict these variables, known data are used :

- Digital elevation model and its derivatives like aspect and slope
- Solar irradiance
- Other variables discussed to improve the prediction : distance to sea, CORINE land cover...

The Figure \@ref(fig:agromet) shows the architecture of the future platform and steps before data diffusion.


### Importance of the internship for the project

To predict meteorological variables, several statistical method will be tested. The identified methods at this time are multiple linear regression, ANN and several kriging methods.

Two objectives were clearly defined for my internship. I operated in the data acquisition and data analysis steps with the aim of predicting **temperature** using **Multiple linear Regression**.

First, I have collected data which can be explanatory variables for temperature and organised them to be integrated in the analysis and benchmark.

Then, I ran a benchmark experiment where different desired regression learning algorithms are applied to various regression tasks (i.e. datasets with different combinations of explanatory variables and the target weather parameter) with the aim to compare and rank the combinations of algorithm and used explanatory variables using a cross validation resampling strategy that provides the desired performance metrics. And then, I aggregated, by calculating the mean, all the hourly performance measures to choose the method that globally performs the best. For each desired hourly dataset, I applied the choosen method to build a model to make spatial predictions. The predictions and their uncertainty have been vizualized using maps. Finally, I had to make the predictions available on the platform together with its uncertainty indicator.

For a matter of time, this benchmark is run on two large years (from 2015-11-11 to 2018-06-30) because some data were not available before this period.
